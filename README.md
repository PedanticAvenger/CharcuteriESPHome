# CharcuteriESPHome
Port of my initial RPi based dry curing chamber controller platform to be ESPHome based.
Intention is control and remote monitoring via Home Assistant (inside of my efforts anyway) and basic local screen for status display.

The system is anchored round a 3 member group of temp/Humidity sensors with some quorum sensing to have stable and reliable monitoring. (I got bit by failing sensors more than once and having this was foundational to my design criteria.)
